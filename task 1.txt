PORT 135: Used for the Microsoft Remote Procedure Call (RPC) (Remote Procedure Call) Endpoint Mapper Service, which helps clients and servers communicate over a network for various remote management and access tasks

PORT 139: NetBIOS (Network Basic Input/Output System) is a protocol used for communication within a local network. It allows applications on different computers to communicate over a local area network (LAN), primarily used in early Windows-based networks for name resolution and sharing services like files and printers.

Security risks:
sensitive information leakage
unauthorized access to shared files and printers
network mapping for more advanced attacks

PORT 445: Modern version NetBIOS. SMB (Server Message Block), also known as CIFS (Common Internet File System), is a network protocol that allows for file sharing, network browsing, printing services, and inter-process communication over a network.

The SMB protocol provides you with the ability to access resources from a server.

Security risks:
common target for malware, ransomware, and attackers to gain unauthorized access to networks, steal data, or execute malicious code.
